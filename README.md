## ðŸ“– About

**The Unspoken Project** is an interactive wall of anonymous messages â€” a version of [**The Unsent Project
**](https://theunsentproject.com), reimagined by me, beyond just love letters.

Where The Unsent Project collects unsent texts to past lovers, **The Unspoken Project** invites users to express *
*anything they've never been able to say** â€” from friendship, betrayal, and surrender to deep secrets and silent grief â€”
all anonymously.

Every note appears on an almost (infinite) canvas, linked with emotion-coded emojis, forming a universe of what was left
unspoken.
